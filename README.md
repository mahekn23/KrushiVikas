## PURPOSE:

Agriculture and its allied sectors are a major contribution to the Indian economy. In this day and age where everything functions digitally on devices, these areas of occupation need to keep up too. One of our goals was to make our Indian farmers more aware of the variety of E farming features that can be of great use to them. Ours is a small initiative, but is not restricted to a certain level. There seems to be a lot of scope in the future of E farming and also in the scope of our system.
